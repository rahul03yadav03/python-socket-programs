# PYTHON SOCKET PROGRAMS – Networking Practice Using Python


This project contains simple Python programs created to practice **networking concepts**
using Python’s built-in `socket` module.

It is designed for **beginners and undergraduate students** who want to understand
how computers communicate over a network.


# OBJECTIVES


- Learn basic networking concepts (IP, ports, sockets)
- Understand TCP connections using Python
- Practice connecting to servers and ports
- Learn how port scanning works
- Measure connection (ping) time using socket timeout
- Handle networking errors properly


# TASKS IMPLEMENTED

 
- Display the local machine’s IP address
- Attempt connection to a specific IP and port
- Print whether a port is **open or closed**
- Scan a range of ports on a target machine
- Scan common ports
- Measure ping time using TCP socket connection
- Use socket timeout for connection handling
- Handle exceptions like timeout and hostname errors


# REQUIREMENTS


- Python 3.x
- socket module (built-in)
- time module (built-in)
- Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS


# HOW TO RUN

- Open VS Code  
- Open the project folder in VS Code  
- Open any `.py` file from the folder  
- Open the terminal in VS Code  
   - Shortcut: `Ctrl + \``  
- Run the program using the command below:
     -python file_name.py
- Enter the IP address and port number when prompted



# LEARNING LEVEL

- Beginner
- Suitable for undergraduate students
- Good foundation for networking and cybersecurity
